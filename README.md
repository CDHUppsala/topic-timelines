topic-timelines
===============
This timeline visualisation visualises the occurrence of topics over time. It uses the output of the Topics2Themes tool, which extracts topics from a text corpus. The occurrence of these topics are visualised.

The code is still under development, but the visualisation has been used for providing an overview of the content of several different types of corpora.
